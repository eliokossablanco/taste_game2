# My project

## What is it?
This project is a cooking puzzle game where you move pieces of food around a palate to complete orders. You try to maximize value of the order while still serving all ingriedients.

## My Features

1. View Palate shape and size of customers
2. Select and move ingridients around palate
3. Serve ingriedients to customer
4. Match order to be paid
5. Continue serving randomized customers (not yet implemented)

## What my project does well
My project works well as a balanced puzzle game. It is also very expandable for extra features.

# What Remains?

1. randomize customers based on level
2. add pricing for movement options
3. add more foods
4. modify food shapes
5. save/load game progress

I would consider this project complete when the customers are randomized and there is saving and loading
The other features would make it more complete, but not neccessary.

# Time estimate

| Remaining Item | Time Estimate | Priority |
|:-|:-|:-|
|randomize customers based on level| 2-4 hours | Must-have
|add pricing for movement options | >1 hour | Nice-to-have
|add more foods | 1+ hours | High priority
|modify food shapes | 4-5 hours | Nice-to-have
|save/load game progress | 1-2 hours | High priority

# What I learned

* During this project, I felt like I gained a much better understanding of how to use classes and especially how static functions work within classes. I also learned a lot more prectically when you should use arrays vs vectors. Outside of c++, i got to learn how to use git and github, which was something I had been wanting to learn to use for a while. I also feel like I would be much more capable of setting up a project in a way where its possible to finish it easily, which was something I struggled with in the past.

* The hardest part of this project was not actaully in the project iteself, but with trying to get the project to build and debug. I was able to get the project to run fine within clion, but I dont think I have enough understanding of how cmake or c++ work internally to fix my issues. Other than that, I found it hard sometimes to wrap my mind around where data was and where it should be sent.

* If I would to start over, other than starting sooner, I would probably want to draw out a map of the structure of the program, such as with a UML. I would also probably want to make the game with paper first to make balancing better, though that can be done later.

* I am most proud of how well the program works together and how expandable it feels. If I am being honest, I am also proud of how fast I put it together, thought I do wish I had not done that to myself.

* I feel like my understanding of data structures hasnt changed that much, because I already had a lot of that from my high school CS class. My understanding of data structures within c++, however has improved greatly doing this project, as well as my understanding of how to use different types of data structures.
