# CHECKPOINT 2: Second feature plan

##Feature Name
Select food and move

##Description
Select a food from a list of availible, and move origin position

##Why this feature?
I was originally going to select and load shape first, and then modify and move shape.
I decided it would be easier to deal with loading and movment first, and then the shape.

##Classes involved
-Game
-Main
-Food

#Expected user workflow

User would
1. type select food
2. type a name of a food from the list given
3. type a direction to move the origin point of the food
-when they select a new food it should reset the origin point 
-trying to move with no food selected should throw an error message

#Estimated Time
~3-4 hours
