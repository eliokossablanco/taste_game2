\#Checkpoint 1 Reflection



\## What I implemented



Game holds one customer at a time , each customer has its own palate, which contains a 2d array of chars. game accesses the palate from customer and displays it every round.



\##Challenges



The biggest challenge was not in the coding, but in the building. We discussed in class, I will go forward working within the console.



\##Testing results



Not much testing because I couldn't get test to build, and feature one implementation had very little room for error.



\##Questions for next feature

Is there something like enumeration that i can use that stores two variables per. for example, having a String that is associated with a specific int.



\##Time spent



Approximately 6-7 hours due to trying to debug builds
